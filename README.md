# ⚙️ CSE434-PPDSLAB

This repository contains my lab work and learning materials for the **Parallel Processing and Distributed System Lab (CSE434)** course.  
Here I practice concepts of **distributed systems**, **parallel processing**, and **socket programming** using Java through hands-on experiments and projects.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Parallel processing fundamentals
- Distributed system architecture and design
- Java socket programming (client-server model)
- Multi-threading and concurrency
- Inter-process communication
- Custom Java server and networking experiments

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is created to:

- Understand distributed system concepts practically
- Learn socket programming and server-client communication in Java
- Explore parallel processing techniques
- Document academic learning and experiments

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- Java
- Socket Programming
- Multi-threading
- Distributed System Concepts
- Networking (TCP/IP)


## 📌 Note

This repository is mainly for academic learning and experimentation.  
Feel free to explore the code and concepts for educational purposes.
